## Methodology 

1. **SQL Environment Setup**: A SQL environment was set up to execute the queries. MySQL was chosen as the SQL database management system for this project.
2. **Data Loading**: The provided dataset was loaded into the MySQL database. This involved creating a new database and importing the dataset file into the SQL environment.
3. **Data Analysis Execution**: The SQL queries provided in the repository were executed to analyze the data and derive insights. The queries were run in the SQL environment to process the data and generate the required outputs.

By following this methodology, the project objectives were achieved through systematic data loading, cleaning, analysis and execution.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset and addressing the key questions, I hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions and optimizing their sales strategies.
